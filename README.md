# nationalization

This package specifically utilizes data from the Constituency-Level Elections Archive ([CLEA](http://www.electiondataarchive.org./))) to 
	     create party nationalization datasets, which contain effective number of parties measures (ENP), as well as several measures of party nationalization.
	     These measures exist for both Lower Chamber and Upper Chamber election results at three different levels of aggregation: the national level,
	     the party level, and the constituency level. Moreover, Gini measures of inequality are included as well, which are utilized for various measures. This
	     package contains the main function to create and populate these databases, as well as scripts for post-processing of these measures and comparison of
	     said measures to existing measures on the archive.
